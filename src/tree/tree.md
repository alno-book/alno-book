# Tree
A *rooted tree* \\(T\\) consists in a *set of nodes* \\(N\\) and a set of *oriented edges* \\(E\\) that connect pairs of nodes. Among its property we have that:
* each node, except for the root, has *exactly one entering edge* (or exactly one parent)
* the *root* is a special node with no entering edges
* it exists *only a path* from a root to a generic node inside a tree
* there are *no cycles* (just like in DAGs)
* the end nodes (with no child) are called *leaves*
