# Graphs
A *graph* \\(G = (V, E)\\) consists in a set of *nodes* \\(V\\) and a set of *edges* \\(E\\) that connects pairs of nodes. We have different type of graphs:
* *undirected graphs*: order does not matter in the edge definition;
* *directed graphs*: order matters in the edge definition;
* *acyclic graphs*: graph with no cycles;
* *direct acyclic graphs* (DAGs): direct graph with no cycles;
* *weighted graphs*: each edge has assigned a value.


Here follows some definitions:
* \\(n=|V|\\);
* \\(m=|E|\\);
* a graph is *sparse* if it has few edges;
* a graph is *dense* if it has a lot of edges;
* the *in-degree* of a node is the number of entering edges that are connected to it;
* the *out-degree* of a node is the number of outgoing edges that are connected to it;
* a *path* is a sequence of nodes;
* a *cycle* is a sequence of nodes where the first and the last are the same.
